# Linear-Equations-Solver
JetBrains Academy project https://hyperskill.org/projects/40

# About
You’ve come so far! Yet sometimes it’s nice to get back to old and simple basics: shall we remember some linear algebra? In this project, you will write a program that solves linear equations (you wish you had it back at school, don’t you?) It won’t be working with powers and radicals, but on the other hand, it will be able to handle matrices and complex numbers.
# Learning outcomes
Practice the ever-useful essentials (classes, arrays, files) and learn to handle complex numbers and matrices.
